# Tasks Descriptions
The `tasks` directory provides default scoring functions to import easily to perform experiments without the boilerplate code so that the main script is not bloated. It provides a set of fixed tasks that is not meant to be modified. If you are developing and require the flexibility of modifying the task and the details that come along with it, we recommend writing your own custom scoring function in your main script instead of importing from `tasks`.

The `tasks` directory also serves as a way to maintain a QD benchmark task suite that can be easily accesed and used. We implement several benchmark task across a range of domains. The tasks here are classical tasks from QD literature as well as more recent benchmarks tasks proposed at the QD Benchmarks Workshop at GECCO.
